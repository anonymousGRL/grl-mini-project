# GRL Mini-Project

This repository contains the code for the GRL Mini-Project.

We suggest to use the Jupyter-Notebook. The files contain the implementation for the AGIN layer, together with the used models, datasets and evaluation procedures.

The implementation of the AGIN layer is based on the implementation of the [GATv2 layer](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/torch_geometric/nn/conv/gatv2_conv.html#GATv2Conv).
